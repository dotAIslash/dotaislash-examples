# dotaislash-examples

Copy-ready repositories that demonstrate the VERSA `.ai/` layout.

## Planned directories
- `minimal/` — smallest useful `.ai/` folder with comments
- `full/` — all eight categories populated, plus profile overlays
- `frameworks/` — language/framework specific samples (Node, Python, Rust)

## Roadmap
- [ ] Publish minimal example
- [ ] Publish full-stack example with profiles and permissions
- [ ] Add language-specific guides and scripts

Contributions welcome—open an issue describing the example you want to add.
